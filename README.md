### Pull / Push

1. Do a `git pull origin master` at the start of each standard shift: Morning, after lunch, after dinner
2. Do commit regularly throughout the shift, `git push origin <branch>` at the end of each standard shift: Before lunch, before dinner and end of the night. Do not leave for an extended amount of time without pushing your current work!!!!!
3. Create a Pull Request if you have any changes that need to be merged immediately after pushing at the end of each standard shift (See 1)

### Merge Rules

1. If your merge is cosmetic, merge info as all green and another team member agrees (a simple DM is fine) you can merge your own branch to Master!
2. If your merge is functionality / code and the merge info is all green, then 1 team member will have to review and merge that request to Master.
3. f your merge is functionality / code and the merge info is black (conflicts), then 2 team members will have to help solve, and once approved and reviewed by the 2 team members and reviewed, it can be merged to Master.
4. At any point if there are problems or confusion, DM Project Manager to assist.
